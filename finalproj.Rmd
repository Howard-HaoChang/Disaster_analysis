# Introduction

As the pandemic grow rapidly after 2020 and developed a kind of stable pattern nowadays, it has a great influence on the human livings and other activities. Actually this is not the only disaster that had a great influence on humans' live. There are several big disaster that are greatly recorded in the history. For example, the Valdivia Earthquake Strikes Chile, the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the Indian Ocean Tsunami etc. They've all made a big damage on humans' life as well as economic.

We are interested in the disaster damage pattern in different region and different time. Is there any clustering patterns? Is there a inside seasonal pattern? Is there any relation between different disasters? These are all questions that researchers are interested in. We want to use data visualization method to have an intuitive understanding of these patterns.

Also, as we want to know more about the pattern of Covid-19, for we can know about the real world based on this, we also want to compare the Covid-19 pattern and other disaster. It might give us a internal understanding of nowadays pandemic.

# Data sources

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
COVID = read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv')
GDP = read.csv("data/world_bank_gdp.csv")
```

## Deasester Data

Our disaster Data is coming from [The International Disaster Data Center for research on the Epidemiology of Disaster](https://public.emdat.be/data). We downloaded the dataset with default setting. The web page is as shown below:

![International Disaster Data Center Website](docs/disaster_web_Image.png)

The source of the dataset is described as below, and hence high credibility.
> The database is compiled from various sources including UN, governmental and non-governmental agencies, insurance companies, research institutes and press agencies. As there can be conflicting information and figures, CRED has established a method of ranking these sources according to their ability to provide trustworthy and complete data. In the majority of cases, a disaster will only be entered into EM-DAT if at least two sources report the disaster's occurrence in terms of deaths and/or affected persons.

# Missing values

```{r, message=F, echo=F, warning=F}
library(readxl)
library(redav)
library(tidyverse)
library(mi)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(zoo)
```


## Disaster dataset

```{r}
disaster = read.csv("data/disaster_missing.csv") %>%
  select(-X)
```


### By row

```{r}
rowSums(is.na(disaster)) %>%
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>%
  table()
```
It shows that the missing value numbers with different rows. There are for 3555 rows with no missing values, 1748 rows with 1 missing values, 14669 rows with 2 missing values, 4781 rows with 3 missing values and 742 rows with 4 missing values.

Also we want to visualize it by year.
```{r}
missing <- disaster %>% 
    group_by(Year) %>% 
    summarise(sum.na = sum(is.na(Total.Deaths)+is.na(Total.Damages)+is.na(Disaster.Subtype)+is.na(Total.Damages.Adjusted)))

ggplot(missing, aes(x = Year, y = sum.na)) +
  geom_col(color = "blue", fill = "lightblue") +
  ggtitle("Number of missing values by Year") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of missing station values(All Variables)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c('1900','1910','1920','1930','1940','1950','1960','1970','1980','1990','2000','2010','2020'))
```

It shows that the missing value has a increasing trend among all years because the data records are increasing over year.

### By Column

```{r, fig.width=20}
colSums(is.na(disaster)) %>%
  sort(decreasing = TRUE)

plot_missing(disaster, percent = FALSE)
```

It shows that damage and adj.damage gets the most nas, then deaths and subtype.

### By Value

```{r}
tidydata <- disaster %>% 
    rownames_to_column("id") %>% 
    gather(key, value, -id) %>% 
    mutate(missing = ifelse(is.na(value), "yes", "no"))

ggplot(tidydata, aes(x = key, y = fct_rev(id), fill = missing)) +
  geom_tile() + 
  ggtitle("ourdata with NAs") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() + # discrete scale
  theme_bw()+
  scale_y_discrete(breaks = c())
```
It gives a look at the na for each value. However I don't think that there is a relation between the nas in different variable.


## Covid Dataset

```{r}
covid = read.csv("data/covid.csv") %>%
  select(-X)
```

```{r}
sum(is.na(covid))
```

There is no NA value in this data set.
