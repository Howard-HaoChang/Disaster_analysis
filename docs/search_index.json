There are for 3555 rows with no missing values, 1748 rows with 1 missing values, 14669 rows with 2 missing values, 4781 rows with 3 missing values and 742 rows with 4 missing values. Also we want to visualize it by year. missing &lt;- disaster %&gt;% group_by(Year) %&gt;% summarise(sum.na = sum(is.na(Total.Deaths)+is.na(Total.Damages)+is.na(Disaster.Subtype)+is.na(Total.Damages.Adjusted))) ggplot(missing, aes(x = Year, y = sum.na)) + geom_col(color = &quot;blue&quot;, fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Number of missing values by Year&quot;) + xlab(&quot;&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Number of missing station values(All Variables)&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) + scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(&#39;1900&#39;,&#39;1910&#39;,&#39;1920&#39;,&#39;1930&#39;,&#39;1940&#39;,&#39;1950&#39;,&#39;1960&#39;,&#39;1970&#39;,&#39;1980&#39;,&#39;1990&#39;,&#39;2000&#39;,&#39;2010&#39;,&#39;2020&#39;)) It shows that the missing value has a increasing trend among all years because the data records are increasing over year. 4.1.2 By Column colSums(is.na(disaster)) %&gt;% sort(decreasing = TRUE) ## Total.Damages.Adjusted Total.Damages Total.Deaths ## 19931 19917 5334 ## Disaster.Subtype Year Disaster.Group ## 3215 0 0 ## Disaster.Subgroup Disaster.Type Country ## 0 0 0 ## ISO Region Continent ## 0 0 0 plot_missing(disaster, percent = FALSE) It shows that damage and adj.damage gets the most nas, then deaths and subtype. 4.1.3 By Value tidydata &lt;- disaster %&gt;% rownames_to_column(&quot;id&quot;) %&gt;% gather(key, value, -id) %&gt;% mutate(missing = ifelse(is.na(value), &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) ggplot(tidydata, aes(x = key, y = fct_rev(id), fill = missing)) + geom_tile() + ggtitle(&quot;ourdata with NAs&quot;) + scale_fill_viridis_d() + # discrete scale theme_bw()+ scale_y_discrete(breaks = c()) It gives a look at the na for each value. However I don’t think that there is a relation between the nas in different variable. 4.2 Covid Dataset covid = read.csv(&quot;data/covid.csv&quot;) %&gt;% select(-X) sum(is.na(covid)) ## [1] 0 There is no NA value in this data set. 4.3 GDP Dataset GDP = read.csv(&quot;data/GDP.csv&quot;) This is a time series data from 1960 to 2020 for the countries around the world, we want to check the na for each countries and for each Year. 4.3.1 For countries We want to see how many NA are there for each country missing = cbind(GDP[,1:2], NAs = rowSums(matrix(as.numeric(is.na(GDP[,-c(1,2)])), nrow = nrow(GDP)))) %&gt;% arrange(desc(NAs)) head(missing, 10) ## Country.Name Country.Code NAs ## 1 British Virgin Islands VGB 61 ## 2 Gibraltar GIB 61 ## 3 Korea, Dem.

That’s because with the development of the technology, we have more and easier access to collect the data.
